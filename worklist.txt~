# OLD

- Create ROS# subscriber for pointclouds
  - Make ROS create the voxel cloud without having to run Rviz
  - Need to get color for each vertex. Shouldn't be too terribly hard 
  - Counter idea: could pull in depth values with image and offset manually
- Orient pointcloud properly in Unity
- Clean up structure & library
- Get some sample pics of other potentially useful topics
- Possible generation from depth & image streams. Adapt pointcloud.cs

Future Directions:
- Integrate into LEAP
- Subscription to more topics, recreate scene very well
- Publisher to relay LEAP movements

Useful Things to Remember:
- Image & Time Reference messages have been deleted from the "common_msgs" folder as they were recreate and / or had programming errors.
- Had to completely delete common_msgs & rtabmap folders to get Rviz to work (topics had same name is my guess)
- Voxel cloud is very useful for rendering pointclouds
- The nonauto-generated pointcloud.cs seems to be generated via depth & rgb images. Not sure if this is a message file or...Gonna move it back to where it was for the time being. I do not believe it is.

# Week of 10/5/20

Development:
 - Continue developing with Magic Leap, get pointclouds to render dynamically. Rework subscriber start()
 - Hololens 2 development and trial.

Experimentation:
 - Develop pointing triangulation method
 - Read pertinent research papers

Future Directions:
 - Integrate fully to Hololens 2
 - Develop memory / retention task
 - Consider paper writing, presentation
	- Conferences? I can't remember...Look up email

Notes:
